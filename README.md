# Hello!

The goal of this task is to:

1. Help us understand your knowledge of React and Javascript.
2. Get a feel for what it's like to work together.
3. Have fun!

**It is not required to finish all the tasks. Just do your best and ask as many questions as you'd like.**

## Instructions:

1. Change how we fetch Pokemon to use a real API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon).
2. Instead of a traditional pagination control, our designer is asking for a "Load More" button that appends the next set of Pokemon to the current list, in effect allowing the user to keep all loaded Pokemon displayed until the end of the dataset.
3. Add more info about Pokemon to the PokemonDetail component.
4. If time allows and to help us prevent regressions in the future, some basic testing would be great!
